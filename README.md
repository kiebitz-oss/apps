Welcome to the Kiebitz project! Please visit our [website](https://kiebitz.eu) to learn more about us.

# Getting Started

Kiebietz consists of three apps for providers, mediators and users, which can be reached under `/provider`, `/mediator` and `/user`, respectively. The app can be built with different environments:

* The `dev` environment works against a locally deployed backend and is great for testing the apps against a real backend.
* The `production` environment build the app bundles for production deployment, i.e. minified and optimized code that works against the production backend.

To run the app in dev mode, simply run

```bash
npm run-script build-dev
``` 

after running `npm install`. To build the `dev` and `production` versions simply run

```bash
# build the development version
npm run-script build-dev
# build the production version
npm run-script build
```

# Linting & Formatting

We use `eslint` and `prettier` for linting and formatting of code. To lint code, run

```bash
# just lint
npm run-script lint
# lint and autofix where possible
npm run-script lint-fix
# lint SCSS
npm run-script lint-scss
# lint and fix SCSS where possible
npm run-script lint-scss-fix
# format code
npm run-script prettier
```

# Analyzing Bundle Size

You can run the bundle size analyzer (which helps you to identify packages and assets taking up a lot of space in the bunde) via

```bash
npm run-script analyze
```
